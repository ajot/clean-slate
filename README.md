# Clean Slate Script

## Overview
**Clean Slate Script** is an AppleScript that helps clear your digital workspace by closing all open applications and opening a fresh journal entry in Day One. This script is ideal for starting work sessions with a clean slate. It's designed to help you start your day without distractions from leftover apps and browser tabs.

## Features
- **Close All Applications**: Automatically hides all active applications, showing only the desktop.
- **Manage Safari Windows**: Hides any open Safari windows to ensure a clean slate.
- **Launch Day One**: Checks if Day One is running and either launches it or brings it to the forefront.

## üöÄ Getting Started
